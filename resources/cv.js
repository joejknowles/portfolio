## Joseph Knowles

A React obssessed software developer focussed on clean code, with a portfolio of side-projects to prove it. After completing an intensive coding bootcamp I moved to the Czech Republic and took on lead development responsibilities for a React application in an important multi-billion pound wealth-management platform within a year of joining the company.

I'm looking for an opportunity to use my skills with ReactJS to efficiently
create excellent user experiences as part of an agile team.

## Skills

#### Clean code

The long-term maintainability and extensibility of code is essential
for highly productive web-development. I've seen how varying degrees of code
quality can influence this and that's why I am continually focussed on
understanding and applying both industry standard and emerging techniques for
achieving cleaner code.

I applied and improved this skill working on applications during my last job,
my portfolio below contains some examples of me applying this knowledge to small
personal projects. The code is all freely available on GitHub at the links below.

#### Agile / scrum

I was taught the core concepts of agile as part of my
software development training at Makers Academy. The course was  project based,
and  these projects were all completed in an agile manner. The company
Makers Academy itself adhered closely to agile principles, giving me first
hand experience of the agile processes within an extremely successful start up
early on in my career.

My role at my first job after Makers Academy involved agile evangelism. The
company was large and previously worked with waterfall processes. At first I
worked as part of  a small internal agile team to demonstrate the efficacy of
these practices, after that success I moved into client delivery to apply
agile doctrines more widely within the company.

I like to work within modern project management frameworks like agile. I get the
most work satisfaction knowing I'm building experiences that are most useful to
end users, and these iterative frameworks ensure this is done effectively in the
shortest time possible.

#### TDD & BDD

Test Driven Development is foundational to my approach to software. It was a
central part of my initial training, and has continued to guide my work on
personal projects which can be seen in [my portfolio](http://joejknowl.es/). The same
is true for BDD, I wrote a small wrapper for a headless browser, which makes
testing of user interactions on a node/express application simple within Facebook's
Jest framework.

#### Pair programming (including remote pair programming)

I completed the Makers Academy course remotely so I learned by pair programming
over video-calls (specifically google hangouts, which I suppose I'm an expert in
now). This required that I demonstrate outstanding communication skills to
clearly convey programming specifics as well as more abstract software concepts
which I then put into practice by teaching other developers via pair programming
at FNZ.

### Technologies

Main technologies I know and particularly want to work with:

- React.js
- Various React compatible libraries - Redux / Redux-saga / React-router
- Webpack
- React-Native
- Git + GitHub
- Various testing frameworks such as 'Jest' for react and 'Rspec' for Ruby
- Node / express
- Ruby on Rails

I've worked with a wide variety of languages and frameworks from my beginnings with
Ruby (on Rails) to currently working mostly with javascript, especially React and Node.
I'm particularly drawn to react and find myself fairly deep in the vast ecosystem that it
occupies.

Other technologies I'm comfortable with include: HTML+CSS, C#, ASP.NET, VB, plain javascript, AWS, CI (Travis, TeamCity), AccuRev.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February to June 2015)

I was part of the first cohort to complete Makers Academy's highly intensive,
full time coding bootcamp remotely. This course culminated in designing a fully functional
'garden sharing' web app in just two weeks to match the
needs of a real client, as part of a small team of developers. During the course I showed my
driven nature by working many hours on evenings and weekends on top of core
course time and completing all challenges above specification long before
deadlines.

#### University of York

- Biology BSc 2:1 (2010 - 2014)
  - Mainly focussing on genetics and molecular biomedicine
  - Completed a final project involving computational analysis of DNA
  - Completed a Spanish elective during my final year, went from nothing to conversational proficiency in less than a year


#### ABRSM

- Piano Grade 8
